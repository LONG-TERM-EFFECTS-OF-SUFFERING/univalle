# univalle

A curated archive of materials from the courses I completed in my Ingeniería de Sistemas program in the Universidad del Valle. Everything is organized by semester/subject, and it is shared in case it helps other students with study, review, or inspiration (and, honestly, because I did not want to keep all these files sitting on my computer forever).
